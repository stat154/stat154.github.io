#### Bin Yu ####

You must enroll in the lecture and one lab. See the [Academic Guide](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-spring-stat-154-001-lec-001) for details. You can attend only the discussion section and lab in which you are enrolled.


### How to Study ###
Participate in lectures and lab sections. We try to give useful lectures and select useful exercises for the lab sections. Lab section content is designed to provide practice relevant to homework, lab, and exams. Don't miss out.

Each lecture contains a lot of detailed material. It's not reasonable to expect that you will simply remember it all when you start doing your homework. The assignments are created under the assumption that you will have read the text (yes, really). This is standard in upper division math and stat classes.

You will be able to follow the text much faster if you have attended lecture. You will be able to do your homework much faster and more independently if you have done the preparatory work beforehand.

To help you select what to read and practice, there will be weekly study guides.

The material in Stat 154 builds on itself week after week. Work regularly so that you don't fall behind; don't expect to do well by cramming right before tests. If there is something you don't understand, make use of staff office hours. We'll be there to help.

### The Required Components of Your Work ###
- **Biweekly homework** which you will turn in on Gradescope. Most of the homework will be done in R Markdown. Homework will be posted on Thursday and will be due by 6 p.m. on Wednesday two weeks later. In some weeks there may be deviations from this due to exams or holidays; we'll let you know.
- **Weekly lab** typically involving both math and computing. **You may attend only the lab in which you are enrolled.**
- **Midterm in class on Tuesday April 2**, in Week 11 after the Spring break. No substitutes except as required by university rules. No computers involved.
- **Final Exam on TBA**, in Week 17. Room to be announced. No substitutes except as required by university rules. No computers involved. **The final is required for a passing grade. Please make sure that you are not enrolled in a class that has a conflicting final exam.**

### Grading ###
In the calculation of your overall score, we will drop
- your lowest homework scores

Course grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:
- Homework 30%
- Labs 25%
- Midterm 20%
- Final 25%

### Collaboration and Integrity ###
Copying assignments from one another is not only dishonest, it also doesn’t help anyone. Each exercise requires its own combination of ideas, and each student needs practice in coming up with those combinations, or else they will be at a loss when trying to use probability theory in their future work. From a purely practical perspective, all students must work independently on Prob 140 quizzes and exams – no collaboration allowed. If a test is the first time a student works independently, then the test is not likely to go well.

Stat 154 materials including exams and solutions are the intellectual property of the course developers. From the campus statement on [Academic Integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/statements-course-policies): "... students may not circulate or post materials (handouts, exams, syllabi,–any class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor."
