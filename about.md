### What is Stat 154? ###

Theory and practice of statistical prediction. Contemporary methods as extensions of classical methods. Topics: optimal prediction rules, the curse of dimensionality, empirical risk, linear regression and classification, basis expansions, regularization, splines, the bootstrap, model selection, classification and regression trees, boosting, support vector machines. Computational efficiency versus predictive performance. Emphasis on experience with real data and assessing statistical assumptions.

### Stat 154 prerequisites ###

Mathematics 53 or equivalent; Mathematics 54, Electrical Engineering 16A, Statistics 89A, Mathematics 110 or equivalent linear algebra; Statistics 133, 134; Statistics 135 or equivalent; experience with some programming language. Recommended prerequisite: Mathematics 55 or equivalent exposure to counting arguments.

### What is the best way to succeed in Stat 154? ###

Stat 154 is an upper division course that requires both mathematical and programming backgrounds. Students are expected to have a corresponding degree of independence, discipline, and mathematical maturity.

In every class I teach, I aim to make learning as efficient and enjoyable as possible. In particular, I try to make the lectures a great way to learn the material, so show up (there will be no videos) and ask lots of questions. A preparation guide is provided each week; it lists the reading and practice that students should do before attempting the week's assignments. These lists aren't just decoration. They are designed to be helpful. Homework will go faster if you've done the reading and some practice first.

### Will Stat 154 be offered in both Fall 2019? ###
Yes.
