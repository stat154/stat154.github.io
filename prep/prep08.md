## Week 8 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Chapter 12](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_12/00_Standard_Deviation),
[Chapter 13](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_13/00_Variance_Via_Covariance)

**Recommended:** Pitman Section 3.3 (pages 185-195) and 6.4 (pages 430-431, 441-443)

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

Each Review Set has two parts: The Basics and Additional Practice. Please do all the problems on the Basics list below. Then do as many as you can from the Additional Practice list. You might not have time to get to them all. That's OK â€“ if you have been practising coming up with solutions yourself, you should be able to tackle new problems on tests. 

[Review Set 3](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_15/06_Review_Problems_Set_3) is based on the material of Chapters 12 through 15. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well.

- The Basics: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Additional Practice: 11, 16, 19, 20, 21, 26

### Discussion Section ###
Sections will cover problems from the Review Sets, selected partly to help with the week's lab and homework.
