## Week 15 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Chapter 23](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_23/00_Multivariate_Normal_RVs),
[Chapter 24](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_24/00_Simple_Linear_Regression)

**Recommended:** Pitman Section 6.5

### Practice Problems ###
The key this week, more than any other week, is the reading. Make a list of the formulas used and redo the examples yourself after reading them.
