## Week 5 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Chapter 9](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_09/00_Conditioning_Revisited), [Chapter 10](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_10/00_Markov_Chains)

**Highly recommended:** Pitman Section 6.2

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

The [Review Set on Conditioning and Markov Chain](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_11/05_Review_Conditioning_and_MC) is short. Please do all the problems in it.

### Discussion Section ###
There is a quiz in section this week. After the quiz, the GSIs will help you set up the calculations for Exercises 4, 5, and 7a of the [Review Set on Conditioning and Markov Chain](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_11/05_Review_Conditioning_and_MC).

### Quiz 2 Content ###
[Review Set 2](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_08/04_Review_Problems_Set_2) and Homeworks 3 and 4
