## Week 10 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Chapter 16](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_16/00_Transformations),
[Chapter 17](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_17/00_Joint_Densities)

**Recommended:** Pitman Sections 4.4, 5.2 (especially the facing-pages spread on pages 348-349), and 4.6

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

[Review Set 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/05_Review_Problems_Set_4) is based on the material of Chapters 16 through 18. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well.

- The Basics: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Additional Practice: 11, 14, 17, 19

### Discussion Section ###
There will be a quiz during section this week. In the time after the quiz, the section will cover the following.

[Review Set 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/05_Review_Problems_Set_4) 3, 5, and (if there is still time) 14. From now on, you should expect that solutions will be set up in section but that you might have to complete the work by doing some calculus yourself later.

### Quiz 3 Content ###
Chapters 12-15, Review Set 3, Homework 7, Homework 8
