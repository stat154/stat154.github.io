## Week 13 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Chapter 22](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_22/00_Prediction)

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

[Further Review Exericses](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_25/04_Further_Review_Exercises) consist of several problems on the material of Chapters 19 onwards. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well. 

We will be adding more problems during the last few weeks of the semester, not only from the remaining chapters but also from the earlier ones.

The set is still rather short. Please do all the problems that are not on the Section list below; many were on last week's Prep list.

### Discussion Section ###
There will be a quiz in section this week. In the time left after the quiz, the sections will cover:
