## Week 11 Preparation Guide ##

Please do the required reading before attempting problems. Not only does it contain the material you need for the week's work, and more examples than in the lectures, it will remind you of the details that you have to keep in mind when attempting problems. You will solve problems faster if you read first.

### Reading ###
**Required:** Textbook [Section 17.4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_17/04_Beta_Densities_with_Integer_Parameters), [Chapter 18](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/00_The_Normal_and_Gamma_Families),
[Chapter 19](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_19/00_Distributions_of_Sums)

**Recommended:** Pitman Sections 4.6, 5.3, and 5.4

### Practice Problems ###
The goal of practice is for you to figure out how to get started on a solution and see it through to the end. To achieve this, you have to be prepared to go over the background reading and examples and then mess around with the ideas **yourself** to come up with steps that will lead to a solution. It will not be achieved if you just read solutions created by others.

[Review Set 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/chapters/Chapter_18/05_Review_Problems_Set_4) is based on the material of Chapters 16 through 18. Those chapters build on the previous ones, so you have to be familiar with the previous chapters as well.

- The Basics: 8, 9
- Additional Practice: 11, 12, 18, 22

### Discussion Section ###
Sections will cover problems from the Review Sets, selected partly to help with the week's lab and homework.
